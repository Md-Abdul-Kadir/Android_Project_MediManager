    <string name="one">Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains.
Adults should eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables per day.
You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables by always including veggies in your meal;
eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating
them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition
 and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</string>
    <string name="two">Filipinos consume twice the recommended amount of sodium, putting them at risk of high blood pressure,
        which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people get their sodium through salt. Reduce your salt intake to 5g per day, equivalent to about one teaspoon. It’s easier to do this by limiting the amount of salt, soy sauce, fish sauce
        and other high-sodium condiments when preparing meals; removing salt, seasonings and condiments from your meal table;
        avoiding salty snacks; and choosing low-sodium products.
On the other hand, consuming excessive amounts of sugars increases the risk of tooth decay and unhealthy weight gain.
 In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake.
This is equivalent to 50g or about 12 teaspoons for an adult. WHO recommends consuming less
than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits. You can reduce your sugar intake
 by limiting the consumption of sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages.</string>
    <string name="three">Fats consumed should be less than 30% of your total energy intake. This will help prevent unhealthy weight gain and NCDs. There are different types of fats, but unsaturated fats are preferable over saturated fats and trans-fats. WHO recommends reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake; reducing trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and replacing both saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats.
The preferable unsaturated fats are found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean,
canola and olive oils; saturated fats are found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream,
 cheese, ghee and lard; and trans-fats are found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods,
such as frozen pizza, cookies, biscuits, and cooking oils and spreads.</string>
    <string name="four">There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol can lead to health problems such as mental and behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis, some cancers and heart diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence and road clashes and collisions.</string>
    <string name="five">Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Tobacco kills not only the direct smokers
but even non-smokers through second-hand exposure. Currently, there are around 15.9 million Filipino adults who smoke
tobacco but 7 in 10 smokers are interested or plan to quit.

If you are currently a smoker, it’s not too late to quit. Once you do, you will experience immediate
and long-term health benefits. If you are not a smoker, that’s great! Do not start smoking and fight for your right to breathe tobacco-smoke-free air.</string>
    <string name="six">Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced
by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. This includes
exercise and activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores,
travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits. The amount of physical activity you need
depends on your age group but adults aged 18-64 years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
 physical activity throughout the week. Increase moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week for additional health benefits.</string>
    <string name="seven">Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is called a “silent killer”.
This is because many people who have hypertension may not be aware of the
problem as it may not have any symptoms. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to heart,
 brain, kidney and other diseases. Have your blood pressure checked regularly by a health worker
so you know your numbers. If your blood pressure is high, get the advice of a health worker.
This is vital in the prevention and control of hypertension.
</string>
    <string name="eight">Getting yourself tested is an important step in knowing your health status,
especially when it comes to HIV, hepatitis B, sexually-transmitted infections
(STIs) and tuberculosis (TB). Left untreated, these diseases can lead to serious
complications and even death. Knowing your status means you will know how to either
 continue preventing these diseases or, if you find out that you’re positive, get the care
and treatment that you need. Go to a public or private health facility, wherever you are comfortable, to have yourself tested.</string>
    <string name="nine">Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases.
Vaccines work with your body’s natural defences to build protection
against diseases like cervical cancer, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis
 B, influenza, measles, mumps, pneumonia, polio, rabies, rubella, tetanus,
typhoid, and yellow fever.</string>
    <string name="ten">Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains.
Adults should eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables per day.
You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables by always including veggies in your meal;
eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating
them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition
 and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</string>
    <string name="eleven">Diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis are transmitted through the air.
 When an infected person coughs or sneezes, infectious agents may be passed on to others
through airborne droplets. When you feel a cough or sneeze coming on, make sure
you have covered your mouth with a face mask or use a tissue then dispose it carefully.
If you do not have a tissue close by when you cough or sneeze,
cover your mouth as much as possible with the crook (or the inside) of your elbow.</string>
    <string name="twelve">Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals in the world.
 Diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria and lymphatic filariasis are transmitted
by mosquitoes and continue to affect Filipinos. You can take simple measures to protect
yourself and your loved ones against mosquito-borne diseases. If you’re traveling to an
 area with known mosquito-borne diseases, consult a physician for a vaccine to prevent
diseases such as Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever or if you need to take antimalarial medicines.
 Wear light-coloured, long-sleeved shirts and pants and use insect repellent. At home, use window and door screens,
 use bed nets and clean your surroundings weekly to destroy mosquito breeding sites.

    <string name="fourteen">Drinking unsafe water can lead to water-borne diseases such as cholera,
diarrhoea, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Globally, at least 2 billion
people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. Check with
your water concessionaire and water refilling station to ensure that the
water you’re drinking is safe. In a setting where you are unsure of your
water source, boil your water for at least one minute. This will destroy
harmful organisms in the water. Let it cool naturally before drinking.</string>
    <string name="seventeen">
Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest public health threats in
our generation. When antibiotics lose their power, bacterial infections
become harder to treat, leading to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays,
 and increased mortality. Antibiotics are losing their power because of misuse and
 overuse in humans and animals. Make sure you only take antibiotics if prescribed by
 a qualified health professional. And once prescribed, complete the treatment days as instructed. Never share antibiotics.</string>
